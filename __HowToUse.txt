Default Hotkeys:

Open Instances: [
Close Instances: ]
Reset: NumpadEnter
Play 1-9: Numpad1-9
Play 10: Numpad0
Play 11-15: Ctrl+Numpad1-5
Return To Wall: NumpadDot
Mute Instances: NumpadSub

If you put the Pcraft15_Wall folder on your desktop and run Wall.ahk it should just work. If you want to put it somewhere else you have to replace all the file paths in Wall.ahk to the correct ones. To change hotkeys replace the hotkey (e.g. NumpadEnter::) with your new hotkey.
